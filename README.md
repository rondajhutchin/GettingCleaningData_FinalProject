# GettingCleaningData_FinalProject
The Getting and Cleaning Data in R final project 
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository has a ReadMe, CodeBook, and code (R script called run_analysis.R) for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" final Project.

  First, download and unzip the data file into your R working directory.
  
  Second, download the R source code into your R working directory.
  
  Finally, execute R source code to generate tidy data file (TidyFile.txt).

Dataset is from a study from the websites listed below.  The data was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

The "run_analysis.R" script does the following per the instuctions below:
Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
